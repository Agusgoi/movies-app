# Movies App

This is my final work for the FrontEnd Developer course. This app was developed with React JS + Vite, Context was used for global states and MUI for styling.
At MOVIES APP you will be able to navegate into different sections (Carousel, Scrollers), categories (Up-Coming, Popular) and even search your favorite movie on the Search input. You will find details on each movie (title, overview, languages, production country) clicking on it and see the trailer if wanted.
